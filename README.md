# Kadane_Enhanced
An enhanced version of the Kadane Algorithm. Now, it also returns the range of maximum summing array apart from that sum.  
This project was prepared back in March 2017, but released now.  
  
Performance:
  It clearly outperforms the conventional Kadane's Algorithm.
Benefit:
  User gets two benefits: (1) Better performance (2) Better result, i.e., apart from just the maximum sum, it also gives the range of that maximum summing subarray.  
    
Files:
  1) main.cpp -- the file that I use(d) for testing.
  2) kadane_e.cpp -- that algorithm
